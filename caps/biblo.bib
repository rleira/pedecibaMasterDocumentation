They have had widespread successes in attacking a variety of difficult combinatorial optimization problems that arise in many practical areas. This bibliography provides a classification of a comprehensive list of 1380 references on the theory and application of metaheuristics. Metaheuristics include but are not limited to constraint logic programming; greedy random adaptive search procedures; natural evolutionary computation; neural networks; non-monotonic search strategies; space-search methods; simulated annealing; tabu search; threshold algorithms and their hybrids. References are presented in alphabetical order under a number of subheadings.}},
